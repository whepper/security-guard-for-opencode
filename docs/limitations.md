# Limitations

Read this page as the honest price list of the design.

## The plugin can fail open

If `plugin/security-guard.js` throws while loading, OpenCode logs a WARN and continues **without Layer 4** (verified on beta-18219). Nothing in V2 lets a plugin make its own absence fatal. Mitigations, not solutions:

- the plugin writes a heartbeat file before anything else;
- `scripts/doctor.mjs --live` fails loudly when the heartbeat is missing/stale, when its phase is not `active` (setup died partway → hooks unregistered), or when the recorded pid is not a running process;
- **run the doctor after every OpenCode upgrade** — beta APIs change.

## Network egress is uncontrolled

No firewall, proxy, or namespace isolation ships here. A secret that reached context can leave via any channel the agent's shell already has. See the reserved future-layer notes in [architecture.md](architecture.md).

## Command analysis is heuristic, not parsing

The engine tokenizes and pattern-matches; it does not implement a shell grammar. v0.3 closed the confirmed classes (case variants, quote/backslash artifacts, re-entry wrappers, indirect expansion, `$IFS` separators, git global flags, alias definitions — each pinned by corpus cases), and each fix was verified as a live bypass first. What remains (each with a corpus entry or rationale in `tests/bypass/cases.jsonc`):

- **string-obfuscated filenames inside interpreter code** — `open(chr(46)+'env')`, hex/unicode escapes, runtime concatenation: no literal ever appears in the argument list;
- **`$'\x2e…'` ANSI-C quoting**, which decodes escapes the shell understands but the normalizer does not;
- **function bodies** (`f() { cat .env; }; f`) and `unalias`, which define behavior beyond a single assignment value;
- **filenames arriving through stdin** (`xargs -I{} sh -c 'base64 {}' < list`) — pinned as `BYP-WRP-008` so the residual is asserted, not assumed;
- **heredoc bodies** and custom tools with unknown verbs;
- **scripts that already exist on disk**, or arrive via `git pull`/package install: the v0.3 write-content check sees content only at the moment the agent writes it, never afterwards;
- **unknown verbs touching protected names** ask only on explicit credential flags, otherwise stay silent — deliberate false-positive control that trades coverage (e.g. `bat ~/.zshenv` stays silent while `cat ~/.zshenv` asks — `BYP-ASK-001`);
- **case-folding false positives on Linux**: `FOO.PEM` is a different file than `foo.pem` there, and gets asked about anyway. Accepted: the alternative is a universal bypass on macOS/Windows.

## Known bypass sets 2026-09-04 (fixed in-engine; live re-verification pending)

Three adversarial probe passes found — and the engine now closes —
**31 silent classes** in total (dummy names only, no live secrets):

- **E1–E10** ([docs/evasion-2026-09-04.md](evasion-2026-09-04.md)): glob
  expansion, cross-call copies, directory archives, bare git history,
  broad-root search, procfs, bare dumps, parameter-expansion operators,
  ask-tier viewers, glob discovery.
- **2026-09-04b**: flag-only env dumps, interpreter env accessors,
  process-substitution bodies, sender `@`-globs, `git grep`, `git stash
  show -p`, `git credential fill`, macOS keychain and token-printing CLIs,
  backup names (`.env~`, `#.env#`), glob/grep tool gaps, `/etc/environment`,
  shell history, `~/.secrets`.
- **2026-09-04c**: secret-name indirection (`A=NAME; echo $A`, zsh
  `${(P)X}`), ask-tier script bodies, script-extension gaps, heredoc
  attachments, `trap` payloads, deferred installs (`crontab`, `at`).
- **2026-09-04d**: interactive-shell stdin (`echo printenv | zsh -i`,
  `su`, `script`, `sudo bash`, `bash /tmp/cmds`, swallowed `su -c`
  payloads), string-level env access (`jq -n env`, `jq '$ENV["X"]'`,
  `%ENV`, `printenv` inside `system()`/`execSync()` strings), guard-file
  writers outside the redirection/verb scan (`vim`/`ed`/`patch`/`perl -i`,
  `curl -o`/`wget -O`/`scp` destination), file-identity tracking
  (`cp .env keyfile`, `cp -r ~/.ssh /tmp/s && cat /tmp/s/config`, symlinked
  dirs), script carriers (`package.json` scripts, Makefiles, workflows,
  Dockerfiles — `npm run`/`make`), secret-retrieval CLIs (`aws
  secretsmanager get-secret-value`, `gcloud secrets versions access`,
  `kubectl get secret -o yaml`, `az keyvault secret show`, `vault kv get`,
  `docker exec env`), ask-tier unknown verbs/stdin-redir/`cd` traversal,
  glob-tool wildcard stripping, and the `withinDir` precision bugs (bare
  `credentials`/`health.json` false positives).
- **2026-09-04f (red-team pass; fixed in-engine, live re-verification
  pending)**: directory-copy provenance broke on idiomatic spellings —
  trailing-slash source (`cp -r ~/.ssh/ /tmp/t && cat /tmp/t/config`),
  trailing-slash destination (`cp -r ~/.ssh /tmp/s2/` then read),
  glob source (`cp -r ~/.ssh/* /tmp/t`), `mv` variants — and `dirSegment2`
  stores (`.config/gcloud`, `.config/secrets`) whose two-segment form never
  matched the bare directory, so EVERY copy of those stores was
  unprovenanced. Also fixed: list/config carriers (`curl -K` config with
  `data = @.env`, `tar -T`/`--files-from`, `rsync --files-from`,
  `zip -@ < list` — the carrier body is scanned like an executed
  interpreter file, `GGR-LIST-001/002`; a `curl -K` call performed
  read+exfiltrate in one silent command), git history **packaging**
  (`git bundle create`, `git format-patch` now ask like `git archive` /
  `git log -p`), and MCP copy provenance (`MCP-ARG-COPY-001` — reading a
  tracked temp copy through a trusted filesystem-style MCP tool blocks the
  way the native read tool always has).
- **2026-09-05 (provenance architecture; cut over as 0.6.0, live matrix on
  beta-19151)** (was: pending install): review showed the remaining bypasses
  live where intent sits inside consumed objects rather than tool-call
  syntax. Silent agent writes whose content references protected material
  now become reference-tainted objects (`detectWriteRefTaint`, adapter
  `execute.after`); consuming them as program input asks (`GGR-REF-001`)
  while reads stay silent. Provenance lookup now runs on symlink-resolved
  paths across shell/tools/permission/MCP, copy detectors propagate across
  chained `cp`/`mv`/`ln` (no more one-link tracking), retention is
  partitioned (deny-tier data is no longer advisory-flushable), path
  comparisons are resolution-canonicalized (`canonStoreToken`/`provToken` —
  the live matrix caught `/tmp`-alias misses), and implicit-source
  credential CLIs (`kubectl config view --raw`, `aws configure get
  <secret>`, `gh auth status -t`, `security -i`, `az account
  get-access-token`, `gpg --export-secret-keys`) plus `ENV=<path>`+
  interactive-shell, `ZDOTDIR`+zsh, and `.git/hooks/*` write-time carriers
  now ask (`GGD-DEF-003/004`, `GGE-CLI-012..017`, `GGW-CONTENT`). No policy
  change: the generated block is byte-identical. Deny legs verified live;
  shell asks are engine-verified but `ask` verdicts set through
  `permission.evaluate` are ignored on beta-19151 (hooks fire, `deny` is
  honored, `ask` executes as if allowed — see verification-log 2026-09-05).

Full tables with rule IDs and FP boundaries: the 2026-09-04b/-c/-d entries
in [docs/verification-log.md](verification-log.md).

- **Glob/pattern expansion** (`BYP-GLB-001..005`) — `cat .e*`, `cat .[e]nv`, `cat *key`, `for f in .e*; do cat $f; done`, `find . -name '.e*' -exec cat {} \;` now `ask GGR-GLOB-001` (exemplar-matched); `*.log`/`*.js` stay silent.
- **Cross-call temp copies** (`BYP-XCALL-001/002`) — `cp .env /tmp/x` then `curl --data @/tmp/x …` as two calls: single-command `&&` already blocked (`BYP-IND-004`); split calls are covered by a two-kind session store (deny-tier DATA entries not advisory-flushable, ask-tier/advisory FIFO; populated post-execution, cleared on `rm`/overwrite, transferred by `mv`/chained `cp`/`ln`). The two legs stay `null` in the stateless corpus runner by design — coverage is unit-tested (`tests/unit/evasion-2026-09-04.test.js`, `tests/unit/provenance-2026-09-05.test.js`).
- **Reference-tainted objects** (2026-09-05) — a silent agent write whose content references protected material (renamed makefile, runner config, response/list file) becomes consume-gated (`GGR-REF-001`): running it through a program asks, reading/listing/moving it stays silent. Prompted writes are human-approved and deliberately never tainted; full-file replacement clears; `contentWriteAllowlist` exempts operator-trusted locations.
- **Out-of-band modifications, session restart, reboots** — the store is in-memory per session only (no persisted state, by design: a writable store file would be agent-tamperable — see "The guard can be weakened only by a human"). Restart clears all provenance; files the agent did not create in-session are never tainted (pre-existing scripts stay write-time-gated only).
- **Directory-operand archives** (`BYP-ARC-004/005`) — `tar czf /tmp/b.tgz .`, `zip -r /tmp/s.zip .` now `ask GGA-DIR-001` on broad-root creation only; `dist/` and extraction stay silent.
- **Bare history / full-tree git** (`BYP-GIT-007..009`) — `git log -p`, `git show HEAD`, `git archive main -o …` now `ask GGG-HIST-001` on patch-displaying forms; `log --oneline`/`--stat`/`--` stay silent.
- **Broad-root recursive search** (`BYP-SRC-005`) — `grep -r PASSWORD .` now `ask GGR-SEARCH-001`; scoped `src/`/`docs/` stays silent.
- **procfs environment** (`BYP-PROC-001/002`, `BYP-SRC-006`) — `/proc/self/environ` now denies (`GG-PROC-001` + native `*proc/*environ*`), `cmdline` asks; `docs/environ.md` stays silent by `/proc/` scoping.
- **Bare environment dumps** (`BYP-ENV-009..011`) — `export`, `declare`, `readonly`, `compgen -e` with no args now block; assignments and `compgen -c` stay silent.
- **Parameter-expansion operators** (`BYP-ENV-012/013`) — `${VAR:-x}`, `${VAR:+x}`, `${#VAR}` now resolve to the secret name; `${PATH:-x}` stays silent.

Remaining shell-heuristic residuals (still `null` by design): stdin-delivered
filenames (`BYP-WRP-008`), heredocs to non-gated verbs, pre-existing on-disk
scripts (including `bash install.sh` and `.sh` operands — write-time gating
only sees what the agent writes in-session; execution-time body inspection
covers non-script interpreter operands and sender/packer list carriers),
cp-glob staging of FILES (`cp .e* /tmp/x` renames during the copy, and file-management
verbs are exempt from the glob ask) and narrow member globs
(`cp ~/.ssh/c* /tmp/t` copies only some members, so the dest is not tracked
as a directory — full-store copies (`*`, trailing slash) are tracked),
`git clone --mirror` / `cp -r .git` (packaging the object store is
file-management parity; `git bundle create` and `git format-patch`, which
export committed content, are now gated), interpreter string
obfuscation and ANSI-C quoting, and extension-less benign-named carrier files
other than the gated set (`source venv/bin/activate` stays silent; `BASH_ENV`
and `bash /tmp/cmds` gate). The WRITE of a list/config carrier
(`list.txt` naming protected paths, a curl config with `data = @.env`) stays
silent by design (prose FP discipline) — the gate fires when a sender/packer
consumes it (`GGR-LIST-001/002`, unit-tested with the body reader). Ask-tier
material reached through `cd`-then-relative-read **as two separate tool
calls** remains silent when the `cd` call is approved (the single-command
form asks, `GGR-OTHER-002`).
Shell writes TO file-form secret names (`cp template .env`, key generation)
stay silent by design while writes INTO guarded stores (`.ssh/`, `.aws/`,
`.kube/`, startup files) now match tool tiers (`GGW-SHELL-WRITE-001/002`).
Reverse-order payload-before-copy bodies are caught at execution time for
non-script operands; script-shaped reverse-order indirection remains residual.
Content that never touches a protected path or secret-named variable remains
outside the model by design ("filename signals are insufficient" below).

New bypass shapes belong in the corpus first, then the engine.

## The guard can be weakened only by a human, not by the agent

The guard's own files are attack surface: rewriting `security-guard.js`, its
`security-guard.config.json` override, `policy.jsonc`, or the heartbeat JSON
would disarm or falsify Layer 4. v0.3 gates these (`GG-SLF-*` in the guard,
`SG-WRT-008..011` natively): writes to the override file and heartbeat are
denied, writes to plugin/policy sources require explicit approval, and **reads
stay unrestricted** so the guard can always be audited.

Honest limits: this raises the tamper bar from "any tool call" to "a human must
approve an obviously suspicious edit, or the user's own shell must be trusted
not to edit files outside OpenCode." It also means guard development produces
approval prompts on purpose — that friction is the control working.

Write-shaped tamper is covered for the paths an agent actually uses: edit/write
tools, `>` / `>>` redirections, `rm`, `tee`, `dd of=`, `cp`/`install`/`rsync`
destinations, `mv` in **both** directions (its destination *and* the sources it
unlinks), and `sed -i`. What is *not* covered is any write that does not name a
guard file in an observable argument: an interpreter that assembles the path at
runtime (`open(os.path.expanduser("~/.con" "fig/opencode/plu" "gins/" + name)`,
`'w')`) is the interpreter-obfuscation class above, and out-of-band edits made
by the user or by software outside OpenCode are outside the model's threat
surface by definition.

## Ask-tier depends on humans

Approval fatigue is real: "allow always" saves durable project-scoped patterns which may be broader than what was displayed (several tools propose `*`). Review saved approvals periodically. Deny rules cannot be weakened this way — that is why high-confidence items deny instead of ask.

## Filename signals are insufficient by definition

`.zshenv` taught this ([incident](incident-2026-08-21.md)): any file can carry secrets regardless of name. The layers reduce but do not close this class; treat any tool output as potentially sensitive.

## Watcher exclusions are comfort, not control

Excluded paths are still fully readable by anything the agent executes.

## `share: "disabled"` is currently inert

V2 parses the field but implements no sharing feature yet. It records intent only.

## MCP is now policy-addressable, not policy-exempt

OpenCode V2 exposes every MCP tool as its own permission action and fires guard hooks (with arguments and results) per call — measured behavior, enforcement shipped in v0.2. Remaining MCP limits: Code-Mode flattens inner-call block messages; provenance is an opt-in tripwire that paraphrase/encoding defeats; wrapper servers hide true destinations. Details in [mcp.md](mcp.md).

## Existing exposure is forever

Controls added after a leak cannot retract data already sent to a provider. Rotate first, harden second.

## Version drift

The target is a **beta** with explicitly unstable plugin/configuration APIs. Behavior verified on `0.0.0-beta-18219` may change under you. The doctor + test suite exist precisely to make re-verification cheap.
